# 404 Error Page Routing Setup

## Overview
The 404 error page routing has been configured to provide a professional, user-friendly experience when users access non-existent pages on the Chania Skills for Africa website.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. Root `.htaccess` (`/chania/.htaccess`)
- Added `ErrorDocument 404 /chania/404.php` to handle 404 errors
- Added rules to handle specific directories (admin/, api/, public/, shared/) without redirection
- Maintains existing routing to `client/public/` for main site content

### 2. Client Public `.htaccess` (`/chania/client/public/.htaccess`)
- Handles routing within the public-facing site directory
- Returns proper 404 status for non-existent files
- Lets Apache handle 404 errors through the main ErrorDocument directive

### 3. Custom 404 Page (`/chania/404.php`)
- Professional, responsive design matching the site's theme
- Includes:
  - Navigation bar with site branding
  - Animated 404 display with floating background elements
  - Search functionality (redirects to programs.php)
  - Quick action buttons (Go Home, Go Back)
  - Helpful links to popular pages
  - Footer with site information
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- AOS animations for smooth user experience

## Key Features

### Search Functionality
- The search form on the 404 page redirects to `/client/public/programs.php`
- Uses the `search` parameter to filter programs
- Helps users find relevant content even when they land on a 404 page

### Navigation Links
- Home: Returns to site homepage
- About: Links to about page
- Programs: Links to programs listing
- Events: Links to events page
- Contact: Links to contact page

### User Experience Enhancements
- Auto-focus on search input after 1.5 seconds
- Smooth animations using AOS library
- Hover effects on buttons and links
- Error logging to browser console for analytics
- Professional error messaging

## Testing the 404 Setup

### Manual Testing URLs
1. **Existing pages (should work normally):**
   - `http://localhost/chania/` (homepage)
   - `http://localhost/chania/admin/` (admin panel)
   - `http://localhost/chania/client/public/programs.php`

2. **Non-existent pages (should show 404):**
   - `http://localhost/chania/non-existent-page`
   - `http://localhost/chania/fake-directory/`
   - `http://localhost/chania/client/public/non-existent.php`

3. **Test file provided:**
   - `http://localhost/chania/test_404.html` (temporary test page)

### Expected Behavior
- Non-existent pages should display the custom 404.php page
- The page should show proper 404 HTTP status headers
- All links and functionality should work correctly
- Search should redirect to programs page with search terms

## Security Considerations
- The 404 page includes proper security headers
- No sensitive information is exposed in error messages
- Error logging is limited to client-side console (can be extended for server-side analytics)
- Access to sensitive files (.env, .htaccess, etc.) remains blocked

## Customization
The 404 page can be customized by editing `/chania/404.php`:
- Update colors by modifying CSS custom properties
- Change links in the "helpful links" section
- Modify the search destination if needed
- Add or remove animated elements
- Update contact information in the footer

## Maintenance
- Monitor 404 errors through server logs
- Update helpful links when site structure changes
- Test routing after any .htaccess modifications
- Remove `test_404.html` file when testing is complete
