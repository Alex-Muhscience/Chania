2. Select your newly created database
3. Click **Import** tab
4. Upload the `database-setup.sql` file from this deployment folder
5. Click **Go** to execute the import
6. Verify all tables have been created successfully

### Step 3: Update Database Configuration
1. Update your configuration files with the actual database details:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost'); // Usually 'localhost' for HostAfrica
   define('DB_NAME', 'your_actual_database_name');
   define('DB_USER', 'your_database_username');
   define('DB_PASS', 'your_database_password');
   ```

## üìÅ File Upload & Configuration

### Step 1: Upload Project Files
1. Compress your entire project folder (excluding development files)
2. Upload via cPanel **File Manager** or FTP client
3. Extract files to your domain's public folder (usually `public_html`)

### Step 2: Set File Permissions
Set the following permissions via cPanel File Manager:
- **Folders**: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
- **PHP files**: 644 (rw-r--r--)
- **uploads/** folder: 755 with write permissions
- **logs/** folder: 755 with write permissions
- **cache/** folder: 755 with write permissions

### Step 3: Configuration Files
1. Copy `.env.production` to `.env` and update all placeholder values
2. Update `config.production.php` with your actual hosting details
3. Update both admin and client configuration files

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Required Updates in Production Files

#### 1. Database Settings
```php
// In your config files
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'chania_skills_africa');
define('DB_USER', 'your_cpanel_username_dbuser');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_strong_database_password');
```

#### 2. URL Configuration
```php
// Replace with your actual domain
define('BASE_URL', 'https://yourdomain.com/');
define('ADMIN_URL', 'https://yourdomain.com/admin/');
```

#### 3. Email Configuration
```php
// HostAfrica SMTP settings
define('MAIL_HOST', 'mail.yourdomain.com');
define('MAIL_PORT', 587);
define('MAIL_USERNAME', 'info@yourdomain.com');
define('MAIL_PASSWORD', 'your_email_password');
define('MAIL_FROM_EMAIL', 'noreply@yourdomain.com');
```

#### 4. Security Settings
```php
// Generate unique keys for production
define('SECRET_KEY', 'generate-a-64-character-random-string');
define('ENCRYPTION_KEY', 'generate-a-32-character-random-string');
```

## üîí Security Configuration

### 1. Change Default Admin Credentials
- Default username: `admin`
- Default password: `admin123`
- **IMMEDIATELY change these after deployment**

### 2. Update Admin User
```sql
-- Run this SQL in phpMyAdmin after deployment
UPDATE users 
SET 
    username = 'your_new_admin_username',
    email = 'your_admin_email@yourdomain.com',
    password_hash = '$2y$12$your_new_hashed_password'
WHERE id = 1;
```

### 3. Generate Secure Passwords
Use these online tools to generate secure keys:
- [Random.org](https://www.random.org/passwords/)
- [LastPass Password Generator](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator)

### 4. File Security
Create `.htaccess` files in sensitive directories:

**uploads/.htaccess:**
```apache
# Prevent PHP execution in uploads
<Files *.php>
deny from all
</Files>

# Prevent directory listing
Options -Indexes
```

**logs/.htaccess:**
```apache
# Deny access to log files
deny from all
```

- [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)

## üîÑ Automated Backup & Maintenance

### Backup Script Setup
The `backup-maintenance.sh` script provides automated backup and maintenance:

1. **Upload the script** to your server (e.g., `/home/username/scripts/`)
2. **Set execute permissions**: `chmod +x backup-maintenance.sh`
3. **Update paths** in the script to match your server configuration
4. **Test the script**: `./backup-maintenance.sh health`

### Available Commands
```bash
# Create full backup
./backup-maintenance.sh backup

# Database backup only
./backup-maintenance.sh db-backup

# File backup only
./backup-maintenance.sh file-backup

# Clean up old backups and temp files
./backup-maintenance.sh cleanup

# Full maintenance (backup + cleanup)
./backup-maintenance.sh maintain

# Health check
./backup-maintenance.sh health
```

### Automated Cron Jobs
Add these to your crontab (`crontab -e`) for automation:

```bash
# Daily database backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /home/username/scripts/backup-maintenance.sh db-backup

# Weekly full maintenance on Sunday at 3 AM
0 3 * * 0 /home/username/scripts/backup-maintenance.sh maintain

# Daily health check at 6 AM
0 6 * * * /home/username/scripts/backup-maintenance.sh health
```

## üîê SSL Certificate Monitoring

### SSL Monitor Setup
The `ssl-monitor.sh` script helps monitor SSL certificate expiry:

1. **Upload the script** to your server
2. **Set execute permissions**: `chmod +x ssl-monitor.sh`
3. **Update domain and email** in the script
4. **Test monitoring**: `./ssl-monitor.sh check yourdomain.com admin@yourdomain.com`

### SSL Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check certificate status
./ssl-monitor.sh check yourdomain.com admin@yourdomain.com

# Get detailed certificate info
./ssl-monitor.sh info yourdomain.com

# Run monitoring with alerts
./ssl-monitor.sh monitor yourdomain.com admin@yourdomain.com

# Generate monitoring report
./ssl-monitor.sh report yourdomain.com
```

### Automated SSL Monitoring
Add to crontab for automated monitoring:

```bash
# Daily SSL certificate check at 8 AM
0 8 * * * /home/username/scripts/ssl-monitor.sh monitor yourdomain.com admin@yourdomain.com

# Weekly detailed report on Monday at 9 AM
0 9 * * 1 /home/username/scripts/ssl-monitor.sh report yourdomain.com
```
